# Sentimental-Analysis
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and scikit-learn (sklearn) libraries. The sentiment analysis model will be trained and evaluated using labeled data, and the performance will be assessed using the accuracy score metric.

# Instructions:

Install the required dependencies by running pip install nltk sklearn in your Python environment.
Place the labeled dataset in the data/ directory.
Adjust the preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, and model algorithms in their respective files to suit your requirements.
Run main.py to execute the sentiment analysis project.
View the evaluation results, including the accuracy score, to assess the model's performance.

# Note:
Ensure that NLTK's required resources (e.g., stopwords, wordnet) are downloaded using nltk.download('all') or selectively using nltk.download('<resource_name>').
