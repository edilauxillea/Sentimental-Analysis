# Sentimental-Analysis
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and scikit-learn (sklearn) libraries. The sentiment analysis model will be trained and evaluated using labeled data, and the performance will be assessed using the accuracy score metric.
